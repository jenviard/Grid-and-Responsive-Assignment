        <h5> <q>They dressed it in glitter and called it a dream. I called it a battlefield—and I never stopped fighting.</q> — Camille Rhodes</h5>

        <section>
            <p> 
                Camille Rhodes was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, into a household split down the middle—her mother, a pageant coach with a flair for manipulation and vanity, and her father, a narcotics officer at the <abbr title="Louisiana Police Department">LPD</abbr> whose moral compass never wavered. Camille spent her early years backstage at child pageants, watching girls her age get dolled up in sequins and hairspray while she sat in the shadows, absorbing the choreography and quiet cruelty of competition. Her father’s death in a botched drug raid when she was just twelve shattered what little stability she had. Her mother spiraled into addiction, eventually losing custody, and Camille was thrust into the foster system, bouncing between homes and learning to read people like her life depended on it—which it often did.
                <br>Determined to honor her father’s legacy and escape the ghosts of her childhood, Camille joined law enforcement at twenty-two. She quickly carved out a reputation for herself as a fearless and emotionally detached investigator, specializing in undercover work. Her first major case involved a trafficking ring disguised as a modeling agency—an operation that earned her accolades but left her haunted by the children she couldn’t save. From then on, Camille chose her missions deliberately, targeting industries that preyed on youth and glamor, always chasing echoes of her own past.

                When whispers of a drug ring operating through child beauty pageants surfaced called <a href="index.html" target="_blank"> Crowned in Deceit </a>
               , Camille didn’t hesitate. She knew the terrain intimately—the glitter, the grooming, the lies. She crafted the persona “Miss Cammy,” a washed-up pageant coach with a tragic backstory and a syrupy Southern drawl. The role fit disturbingly well. But what she didn’t expect was the emotional connection she’d form with Valentina and Brielle, the daughters of the ring’s masterminds. They reminded her of herself—bright, talented, and trapped in a world they didn’t understand. The mission became personal. Camille wasn’t just dismantling a criminal empire—she was protecting the childhood she never had.
                <br>After Rosa and Janelle’s arrest, Camille turned down promotions and media attention. Instead, she founded Echo Line, a nonprofit that trains undercover agents to work in child-centric industries and provides therapy for kids rescued from exploitation. In her apartment, she keeps a box of pageant memorabilia—tiaras, scorecards, and a glitter-stained teddy bear with a hidden mic. It’s a quiet shrine to the case that changed everything. Though she still struggles with intimacy and trust, Camille has found purpose in being the ghost who haunts predators—and the guardian who watches over the vulnerable.
