                <h2> Synopsis </h2>
                <p>  In the dazzling world of child beauty pageants, where rhinestones sparkle and smiles are rehearsed, two mothers—Rosa Delgado and Janelle Whitmore—run a covert empire that spans coast to coast. Their daughters, darling darlings of the pageant circuit, are unknowingly the glitter-covered camouflage for a drug ring that’s as sophisticated as it is ruthless. But when undercover detective Camille Rhodes enters the scene, the tiaras start to tremble.</p>

                <h3> Act I: The Perfect Cover</h3>
                <p> 
                    Rosa and Janelle met on the pageant circuit—Rosa, a former chemist turned stage mom, and Janelle, a logistics expert with a flair for manipulation. Their daughters, Valentina and Brielle 
                    , were rising stars in the child pageant world, winning crowns and hearts across the country.
                    <br> But behind the scenes, the moms were orchestrating something far darker. Using pageant travel schedules, costume trunks, and the chaotic backstage environment, they moved high-grade narcotics between states. Each competition was a checkpoint. Each dressing room, a drop site. The glitz masked the grit.
                    
                    <br> Their network was vast: stylists doubled as couriers, judges were bribed to look the other way, and pageant organizers unknowingly provided the infrastructure for a criminal empire. Rosa handled the chemistry and product refinement. Janelle managed distribution and laundering through pageant sponsorships and fake scholarships.

                <h3> Act II: Enter Camille</h3>
                <p> 
                    <a href="camille.html" target="_blank"> Camille Rhodes </a> had seen it all—gangs, cartels, white-collar crime—but nothing prepared her for the pastel nightmare of child pageantry. Posing as a pageant coach with a tragic backstory and a fake Southern accent, Camille infiltrated the circuit under the alias “Miss Cammy.”
                    <br>She quickly noticed the oddities: trunks that were always locked, frequent “wardrobe emergencies” that required private rooms, and Rosa’s obsession with “custom blends.” Camille began documenting everything—hidden cameras in makeup mirrors, audio bugs in teddy bears, and GPS trackers in tiaras.
                    <br>But the deeper she went, the more twisted it became. Camille discovered encrypted messages hidden in choreography notes, and a secret pageant held in Las Vegas that was actually a summit for high-level dealers. The moms weren’t just players—they were the queens.

                <h3> Act III: The Fall</h3>
                <p> 
                    Camille orchestrated a sting during the National Little Miss Stardust Finals in Orlando. As Valentina and Brielle took the stage in matching butterfly gowns, federal agents swarmed the venue. Rosa tried to flee through the costume corridor, while Janelle attempted to destroy evidence in the judges’ lounge.
                    <br>But Camille was ready. She cornered Rosa with a line that would later become infamous in law enforcement circles:
                    <br> “You should’ve stuck to glitter, sweetheart. Meth doesn’t sparkle.”
                    <br>The takedown was swift and theatrical—just like the world they’d built. Rosa and Janelle were arrested, their daughters placed in protective custody, and the pageant circuit was left stunned. Camille, hailed as a hero, later wrote a memoir titled Sequins & Surveillance.

                <h3> Epilogue: After the Crowns</h3>
                <p>
                    Years later, Valentina and Brielle would reunite, not as pageant rivals, but as advocates for children exploited by criminal enterprises. Camille, retired but restless, now teaches undercover strategy at Quantico—her classroom decorated with tiaras and caution tape.
                    <br>And somewhere in the archives of the FBI, the case is still known as Operation Glitterbomb.
